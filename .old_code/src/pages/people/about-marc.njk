            <h2 class="h4 fw-bold mb-3">About Marc</h2>
            <p>Marc’s journey began in the U.S. Air Force, specializing in Electronic Switching Systems—where
              precision, reliability, and mission‑critical communications were non‑negotiable. Since then, he has held
              roles from hands‑on technician to senior leader, driving innovation in IT operations, cybersecurity, and
              service delivery.</p>
            <p><strong>Before founding Vulpine Solutions</strong>, Marc spent more than a decade at ConnectWise,
              rising from technical support to senior leadership in Partner Success. There, he worked with managed
              service providers across the globe, fine‑tuning their operations, strengthening their cybersecurity
              posture, and helping them achieve measurable growth.</p>
            <p>Today, Marc leads Vulpine Solutions with one clear mission: <em>deliver secure, reliable, and
                stress‑free IT that lets small and midsize businesses focus on what they do best.</em> He personally
              oversees everything from strategic vision and solution design to hands‑on implementation—ensuring every
              engagement is practical, efficient, and business‑focused.</p>

            <h3 class="h5 fw-bold mb-3">Beyond the Keyboard</h3>
            <p>Off the clock, Marc is a devoted husband to Lisa—a middle school teacher at the Academy of the Holy
              Names and a master’s candidate in curriculum design—and a proud dad of four (ages 12, 13, 20, and 22).
              Two energetic dogs complete the household. A self‑proclaimed “nerd at heart,” Marc is happiest when he’s
              learning, tinkering, or building—assembling a custom Voron 3D printer, experimenting with Kubernetes,
              automating his home, or designing electronics projects with ESP32s. He also loves to travel, cook, and
              explore new adventures with his family.</p>
