## Introduction

Creating a new post on **VulpineMSP.com** is quick and efficient thanks to our Eleventy (11ty) static site generator and Cloudflare Pages workflow. This guide walks you through each step — from writing Markdown to verifying the deployment.

---

## Step 1: Create the Markdown File

All blog posts live under:

```
src/posts/
```

Each post is a Markdown file (`.md`) that Eleventy converts into a static HTML page.

### Naming Convention

Use a simple, lowercase, hyphen-separated filename that includes the date:

```
src/posts/2025-10-20-how-to-create-posts.md
```

This naming pattern ensures chronological sorting and easy organization.

---

## Step 2: Add Front Matter

At the top of the file, include **YAML front matter** to tell Eleventy how to render the post:

```yaml
---
title: "How to Create and Publish Blog Posts on VulpineMSP.com"
date: 2025-10-20
layout: layouts/post.njk
permalink: blog/how-to-create-posts/
summary: "A complete walkthrough for creating, formatting, and publishing new blog posts on Vulpine Solutions’ Cloudflare-hosted Eleventy blog."
updated: ""
tags:
  - post
  - tutorial
  - internal
---
```

**Required fields:**

* `title` → The post’s title displayed in listings.
* `date` → Publication date used for sorting.
* `layout` → Always use `layouts/post.njk`.
* `permalink` → Defines the final URL.
* `summary` → Short description for previews and meta tags.
* `updated:` → (optional) Date of significant updates.
* `tags` → Include `post` plus any topic-specific tags.

## Step 3: Write Your Content

Write your article using standard Markdown syntax.

### Example Structure

````markdown
## Why We Use Markdown

Markdown keeps the writing process simple and portable. It focuses on content instead of formatting, ensuring consistency across posts.

### Formatting Tips
- Use `##` for subheadings.
- Use backticks (```) for code snippets.
- Use `[links](https://example.com)` for references.
- Keep paragraphs concise — they improve mobile readability.
````

### Adding Images

Place all blog images inside:

```
src/assets/images/blog/
```

Then reference them using absolute URLs:

```markdown
![Vulpine Blog Guide](/assets/images/blog/blog-guide-screenshot.png)
```

Images should be optimized as `.webp` files whenever possible.

---

## Step 4: Test Locally

Run Eleventy in development mode:

```bash
npx @11ty/eleventy --serve
```

Your local server will start at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). Verify:

* The post appears under `/blog/`
* Links and images load correctly
* Layout matches your expectations

---

## Step 5: Commit and Push

Once satisfied with the content:

```bash
git add src/posts/2025-10-20-how-to-create-posts.md
git commit -m "Add blog post: How to create posts"
git push origin main
```

Cloudflare Pages will automatically build and deploy the update.

Check the live URL:

```
https://vulpinemsp.com/blog/how-to-create-posts/
```

---

## Step 6: Announce the Post

After deployment, share the post on your preferred platforms:

* **LinkedIn:** Tag @VulpineSolutions and use `#SmartITSilentSecurity`
* **X / Twitter:** Include a short tip or quote from the post
* **Postiz:** Schedule automated cross-platform publishing

---

## Step 7: Maintain and Update

If you discover a typo or want to expand content:

* Edit the same Markdown file
* Update the `date` if it’s a significant revision
* Commit and push again — Cloudflare will redeploy automatically

For SEO, consider adding an `updated:` field in front matter for major edits.

---

## Pro Tips

* Use short, descriptive filenames (avoid underscores)
* Keep front matter consistent across posts
* Add relevant `tags` — they enable future topic grouping
* Reuse components like callouts or tables from previous posts for consistent style

---

## Conclusion

By following this workflow, you ensure that every blog post on **VulpineMSP.com** is cleanly structured, search-friendly, and deploys automatically through Cloudflare Pages. No CMS required — just fast, secure, and predictable publishing.

**Smart IT. Silent Security.**
